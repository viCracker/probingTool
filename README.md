# Probing Tool
This tool checks for the active or live urls from a list of urls stored in a file probably gotten by a web srapper. <a href="https://github.com/viCracker/webscrapper">Check My Webscrapper</a>. It then ouputs the 'good' URLS to a separate file. 
<h2>Usage</h2>
Ensure you have these files in the same directory:<br>
  1. Probe.py - this probing tool<br>
  2. urls.txt - list of urls to check the live URLs from<br><br>
Use command <code>cat urls | python3 probe.py</code> to run the tool.<br>
The tool outputs the 'good' URLs into a file named: filtered_urls.txt. <br>
<code>cat filtered_urls.txt</code>< to see the live URLs.<br>
